Known issues:

1. On sandybridge cpu, intel driver optimizes out vector sp & dp kernels. This is observed only on win64 systems. As a result, this utility shows flops higher than hardware's peak. Need to follow-up on intel forum

2. When --use-event-timer option is used on some AMD GPUs, platform returns zero time on event. As a result, inf is displayed sometimes
